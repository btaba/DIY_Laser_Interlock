DIY_Laser_Interlock
===================

I built a prototype Laser Interlock system for an optics laboratory using an Arduino interfaced to a keypad, switches, LEDs, magnetic sensors, and relay circuits.

I followed these design specifications: http://ncsu.edu/ehs/laser/

The original design was to use a laser shutter, but I resorted to using the laser stop switch found on most lasers. I wired a relay from the Arduino to these ports. All other peripheries are enumerated in the comments section of the main code.
